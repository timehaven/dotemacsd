- Button up skirting around crawl space in 3 or 4 areas.
- Put new insulation around drainpipe and in joist in one area.
- Possibly re-hang insulation that might have fallen from one section
  of joists (cannot remember if I did that or not last time I was there).

The sections of crawlspace that need the skirting installed are:

- under the stairs of the deck, below the bathroom window, on the east
  side of the house (beginning of the first video)
- exactly opposite that, facing the woods, on the west side of the
  house, below the furnace vent stack (walking to it at 2:30 of second
  video)
- just around the corner from that, facing the back yard, where the
  foamed main drain of the house comes out of the crawlspace
- anywhere else you see it (facing the front yard?  at 0:20 of second
  video) 

The new insulation that needs installing is around a drainpipe below
the sink in the arctic entry.  You can see it from the crawlspace
entry on the west side of the house, next to the oil tank (the second
crawlspace section I mentioned above).  It is shown right about time
3:04 in the second video.

The possible insulation that needs putting back up is in a joist
section and is hard to describe but here goes:

Exactly at the beginning of second video, shows corner and short
section of log part of house that butts up against the main deck.  I
do not mention it in the video but below that first section of log,
there might be a section of insulation below the floor that has come
down between the joists.  You can see it either from under that small
porch (very low crawlspace) where I was standing to take the video or
from the side facing the front yard, where I walk around to at 20
seconds into the video.  That skirting should be on the house and
would need to be removed.
